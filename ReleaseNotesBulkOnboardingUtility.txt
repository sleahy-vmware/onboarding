- Support for bulk removal of VMs that have been deleted in vRA 7. This is achieved by setting the deletedvms 
  parameter in the delta section of the onboarding.ini file. The deletedvms file specified must contain a virtualmachines 
  section and a parameter called names. The names parameter should have a value of a comma separated list of VMs to be 
  removed from the dataset. Once removed the VMs cannot be re-added to the onboarding process without starting 
  the entire capture and review process again. Sample content for deletedvms file as follows. The validateOnboardingCSV.py 
  script will detect the file and remove VMs accordingly from the dataset. The validateOnboardingCSV.py will also output a 
  comma separated list of VMs that might have been deleted from vRA 7 and and no longer visible in vRA 8. 
  This list once reviewed and verified can be used to populate the deletedvms file.
